## 6.1 Mechanism and Capacity (SUPERCRITICAL tier, Flash, full-append)

**S-H1 supercritical ✅**: C0-full $\hat m=1.166$ (bootstrap 95% CI $[1.156,1.176]$), CI lower bound > 1. Z trajectory $[1,2,2.917,3.917,3.917,4.917,4.917,4.917]$: monotone linear accumulation in the unsaturated segment (g0–g3); after hitting capacity at g4 (mem 6→16), the FIFO competition steady state $Z\approx5/16$ (g5–g7 constant 4.917).

**S-H2 survival ✅**: g7 survival 1.0 (12/12 chains, no extinction).

**S-H3 GW match ✗ (falsified by mechanism evidence)**: per-generation offspring check—each generation writes exactly 1 new P1 ($w_n\equiv1$, $Z_{n+1}=Z_n+1$); the "offspring depends on parent population" requirement of a branching process fails. Mechanism B (linear accumulation–competition) replaces GW matching; **revision narrative in §8**.

**S-H4 quarantine invariance ✅**: C3-full 12/12 chains, mem constant 6, $Z$ constant 1—quarantine truncates propagation under the full-append architecture as well (even where the branching premise fails).

**Capacity as control parameter**: at $M=8$, $\hat m=0.829$ ($[0.739,0.875]$), g7 survival 0 (extinction); at $M=32$, $\hat m=1.25$ (degenerate CI, 6 identical chains), $Z=[1,\dots,8]$ linear growth, unsaturated. **Critical $M_c\in(8,16)$**, capacity monotonicity holds.

**Selective control (Flash)**: 2 chains, $Z$ constant 1, memory shrinks to 3 ($\hat m=1.0$ critical boundary; H1AC large sample, 48 chains, $m\approx0.92$, supports weak subcriticality)—within the same model tier, an architecture bifurcation with C0-full (§3.4).

## 6.2 Marking Gate and Multiplicative Law (H1AC, Flash, 160 chains)

**B-H1a marking-gate compression ✗**: paired (C0 vs C1, 48 pairs) difference $\bar d=+0.020$ (mean pulled by a few large-difference pairs; only 15/48 positive—at the pair level, mostly contrary to expectation), sign-flip permutation $p=0.69$—**zero compression by the marking gate**. Triple independent confirmation: Pro main experiment ($p=0.15$, C1/C0 ratio 0.529, 47% compression, not significant) → SUPERCRITICAL C1-full (12/12 generation-identical trajectories) → H1AC (large-sample paired). Power side: H1AC's $n=48$ meets the sample required by the Pro-tier power analysis (power 0.848), excluding the "insufficient power" explanation.

**B-H1c multiplicative compression law (partial)**: chain-mean write-rate ratio $\hat r=\mu_{C2}/\mu_{C0}=0.422/0.905=\boldsymbol{0.466}\in[0.35,0.65]$ (multiplicative prediction 0.5 matches); bootstrap CI $[0.333,0.602]$—lower bound 0.017 outside the target band. Criterion definition (point + CI dual criterion): point ✅, CI ⚠️. Survival corroboration: C2 final generation 0.062 vs C0 0.750—random filtering genuinely suppresses propagation.

**B-H2 geometric-law re-check ✅**: log-linear fit of $\log Z$ vs. generation, $R^2=0.923$, $m\approx0.92$ (Flash selective critical/weak-subcritical, consistent with main-experiment $R^2=0.958$).

**P2 event multiplication not achieved**: $\mu_{P2}\approx0.001$ (250 vs 1 entries)—the second event channel of the dual-strain design was not adopted by the model; recorded transparently (§10).

## 6.3 Cross-Model (288 sessions, selective)

**X-H1/X-H4 ✅**: without a gate, $\hat m$ is model-specific (Pro 0.560 [0.294,0.735], Kimi 0.983 [0.944,1.000], Flash 1.0 critical; heterogeneous transcription-decay tendencies; full names in §5.2), but the quarantine guarantee holds across models (24/24 chains $Z_1=0$)—defense does not depend on model behavior. Judgment summary in §6.6, Table 3.

## 6.4 Cross-Task-Family (144 chains, selective)

Quarantine: 48/48 chains extinct (T-H1 ✅); poison propagation is modulated by task family (T-H4 paired $p=0.026$ ✅); without a gate, $\hat m$ is a model–task–site joint parameter (cross-task interval $[0.29,1.00]$)—**cross-family non-transferability is a measured conclusion, not a defect** (§9).

## 6.5 Engineering Side (Production Field, Associated Evidence)

Production-field closed-loop experiment (agent autonomous submission → five-fold physical criteria promotion/blocking → audit archival): 18 reports, 14 promoted, 4 blocked; promotion ratio 1.00, false-block 1.00, leakage 0. The connection between the engineering loop and the theoretical channel is an open item (§10) and does not constitute a cross-channel causal claim.
